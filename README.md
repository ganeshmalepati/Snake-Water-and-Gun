This is a Python-based command-line game inspired by the traditional Indian version of Rock, Paper, Scissors — Snake, Water, Gun. The player competes against the computer, which makes its choice randomly.

Game Rules
- Snake drinks Water → Snake wins, 
- Water douses Gun → Water wins, 
- Gun kills Snake → Gun wins.
- If both choose the same, it's a tie.
